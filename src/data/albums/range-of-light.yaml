title: "Range Of Light"
description: 'Range of Light incorporates elements of his previous work, but also amplifies Carey''s percussive proclivities, and is altogether more developed than its predecessors, with more input on the performance and even composition side from the band of musicians and best friends he assembled originally to bring All We Grow to life in the live setting. "There were times during recording sessions when there were three percussionists, all with different styles and fortes, playing at once, adding different textures." From the flurry of violins over a circular rhythm in ''Crown The Pines'' and the beautiful cries of ''Alpenglow'', to the pensive depths of songs like ''Fire-scene'' and ''The Dome'', Range of Light is a still life of an artist in this particular stage of his life; a stage that has been met with the highest of peaks and the lowest of depths all within the range each of us treads through.'

tracks:
  - title: "Glass/Film"
    lyrics:
      - Counting the hours, come where I lay
      - Slipped through a little hole in the film
      - Silent hills, patchwork fields, fall bitter lines
      - Oh my darling dear
      - Sleep to see what it looks like
      - I never meant to do no harm
      - In the glass, see your face,
      - I know this place, I called the case
      - I was made for this
      - I was tamed by this

  - title: "Creaking"
    lyrics:
      - Oh the lightning falls on dad’s house
      - We were swimming when the monsoons hit
      - Creaking
      - Creaking
      - There are things here I could not see before
      - All my memories found between the boards
      - Creaking
      - Creaking
  - title: "Crown the Pines"
    lyrics:
      - I am in love with this place
      - But I fear for its grace
      - Shoot the sky
      - Opens up like the sea
      - And the resinous high
      - Bloodlines and divines
      - Will my kids see the trees?
      - Will the glen fall on me?
      - Down here we’re careless and we’re primal
      - Where I learned to be a light at dusk
      - Down here we’re careless and we’re primal
      - Where I learned to be a light at dusk
      - Crown the pines
      - I worship the sound
      - Mother cliffs
      - Adorn it, the ground
      - Spread the sand, my father’s land
      - (Dedicated to Dad and Dubs)
  - title: "Fire-Scene"
    lyrics:
      - The city’s fire
      - Trapped behind the earth
      - Digging in your deepest dirt
      - The reddest hue
      - Reminds you of you
      - Clinging love and falling true
      - On and On
      - All I want is honesty
      - Tree has snapped
      - Sparks are flying everywhere
      - Cables burnt and lines flare
      - And when the all in all
      - Comes falling down
      - It was just an accident
      - Something you can’t help
      - On and On
      - All I want is honesty
  - title: "Radiant"
    lyrics:
      - You were radiant
      - And I’m ready
      - For to bring a flower in
      - The sun was up
      - And the frost was gone
      - And in that dew-drop dress a fawn
      - And the spots were on
      - But I’m calm this run
      - Emerging one sun-swept dawn
      - There’s a rise ahead
      - And I’m ready
      - For to bring a flower on the bed
  - title: "Alpenglow"
    lyrics:
      - I’ve been waiting on the proper time
      - I was hoping that you’d take my line
      - Make it pure and make it still
      - You will, you will, you will
      - All mine
      - You were saying when you know you know
      - We were walking in the year’s first snow
      - Hushed white in Alpenglow
      - We lay, we lay, we lay
      - All day
      - I was wondering if you’d be my wife
      - Be the compass in my rugged life
      - Calm this quaking leaf until
      - You will, you will, you will
      - All mine
      - I was hoping you would walk with me
      - Down the Aisles of Light gallery
      - Leave a child with legacy
      - We lay, we lay, we lay
      - All day
      - And when she came
      - I grabbed her head
      - And dipped her in the lake
      - And seldom seen, a side of me
      - Beneath my feet the earthen shake
      - I can’t calm down
      - I’m flooding in spring
      - And swelling from the sound
      - And I am driftwood found
  - title: "Fleeting Light"
    lyrics:
      - Golden hills
      - You live below
      - That bridge is everlasting
      - Bold and bright
      - You blazed the night
      - That trail is never fading
      - Not without the fleeting light
      - Range of Light
      - Adorned in white
      - In fields, first dawn is yawning
      - Not without that fleeting light
      - The future
      - Unfolding
      - The fall light
      - Instilling
      - Hot granite
      - Climbed Half Dome
      - The tan lines
      - In sun-chrome
      - And westward
      - Found tea pool
      - And beach walks
      - With Tiny
      - The steeple
      - The belfry
      - Surpassing
      - The old scenes
      - Come chanting
      - The chorus
      - And cliff side
      - We’ll shore up
      - Small winged
      - The big trees
      - Wawona
      - You miss me
      - The future
      - Unfolding
      - The fall light
      - Instilling
      - Hot granite
      - Climbed Half Dome
      - The tan lines
      - In sun-chrome
      - (Dedicated to Shannon and Gabe)
  - title: "The Dome"
    lyrics:
      - Root the road, my feet are sure
      - Come, I know where we can go
      - Calm the move, the mystery
      - Terraced red, found-sound history
      - Stay, I will be gone be for days
      - Ocean blue and elbow-waves
      - Steep, unfold, unbending path
      - Trust my gut, the beauty-bath
      - Still, I fall too close
      - Be where I say, “I’m yours”
      - The back and forth
      - All unknown is where I’m going
  - title: "Neverending Fountain"
    lyrics:
      - I know my heart better than you may think
      - It swells but keeps on the bank of a May creek
      - And when we see it All
      - And the exit sign
      - We build our scrape past the moors on Cliff-Keep
      - "The bottom line: out of stone I will seep"
      - "We look up: Neverending Fountain"
      - My wings are pure and forever sounding
      - "The sky, my hub, and harken: crowning"
      - Where basins boom and my heart is bounding
      - And when we see it All
      - And the exit sign
      - Where cool creeks collide
      - Of the true and the tried
      - I will be home, hawk-eyed
      - Searching, patient
      - Searching, patient
      - Searching, patient
      - Searching, patient
