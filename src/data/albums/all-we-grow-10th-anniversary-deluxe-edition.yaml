title: "All We Grow (10th Anniversary Deluxe Edition)"
description: "Ten years ago, S. Carey and All We Grow crept into our world like a seedling—delicate and unassuming, but putting down roots that would deepen and grow whether we saw them or not. Ten years later, All We Grow stands as a classic album - born without expectation and met with adoration - a cathartic result of Carey's extraordinary and vibrant life experiences that resonates loss, dreams and heart in a manner so instantly relatable, you feel as though you can touch it."
