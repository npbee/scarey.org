title: "All We Grow"
description: "The debut album from S. Carey, All We Grow, is the result of a young lifetime immersed in music. As a band member of Bon Iver, Sean Carey witnessed a flip of his formal training to step firmly into a worldwide-touring rock band. His performance degree in classical percussion and his love for jazz drumming prepared him for a central role in the inspiring force of the Bon Iver live show."

tracks:
  - title: "Move"
    lyrics:
      - Dream of a vacant pier
      - Move all your maps to here
      - If I could run my fingers through your hair
      - If you could run along the shore and air
      - I would...
      - Keep all my mornings clear
      - Move all your bees to here
      - If I could run my fingers through your hair
      - If you could run along the shore and air
      - I would...
      - Move
  - title: "We Fell"
    lyrics:
      - The consonance of drone
      - And love sounds its own
      - Your arms wrapped around home
      - All the in-betweens
      - Lay so blue beside me
      - We fell
      - More than skin and bones
      - No we're not alone
      - We fell
      - Like stones
      - Between
  - title: "In The Dirt"
    lyrics:
      - Don't leave cause I believe
      - We were meant to sleep
      - In the dirt
      - If you doubt that I'll be there
      - Don't despair
      - Don't you dare
      - Don't leave cause I believe
      - We were meant to sleep
      - In the dirt
  - title: "Rothko Fields"
  - title: "Mothers"
    lyrics:
      - Their feet are cracked
      - As they break their back
      - In the sun-heat
      - It's all, yes, it's all
      - For your pennies
      - Their kids can't go to school
      - In the morning
      - Because narcotics grow better than books
      - And my only hope
      - Is for their mothers and their daughters
      - To be loved
      - Only New York can make it right
      - If they want to
      - The consensus is rather apathy
      - My soul, my soul cries for them
      - In the morning
      - Because I'm guilty just the same
      - But eye to eye
      - I haven't been
      - But my cries are swelling
      - Cause they have faces
      - They have faces
      - And my only hope
      - Is for their mothers and their daughters
      - To be loved
  - title: "Action"
  - title: "In The Stream"
    lyrics:
      - I was folded by ferns
      - You could return, the earth
      - All to her
      - Open mouth
      - Look up and out
      - Fall my failures
      - To the ground
      - I know
      - I know
      - I know
      - All them
      - I am wind in the pines
      - I am a line
      - You can't define
      - When the dawn breaks
      - In my love-lock landscapes
      - I know
      - I know
      - I know
      - All them
      - Be in my vision
      - My gardener
      - I'll be an architect
      - On window steam
      - I'll be in the stream
      - Be in that canyon
      - That corridor
      - I'll be an architect
      - On window steam
      - I'll be in the stream
  - title: "All We Grow"
    lyrics:
      - Full year
      - The iris
      - Red wood
      - All we grow
      - I will be honest
      - I tow
      - What I know
  - title: "Broken"
    lyrics:
      - Stones on weathered shores
      - You were the one
      - I will always be there
      - You wrap your loving arms
      - Around my doubt
      - I am tired of that
      - This won't get broken
      - Home on our front porch
      - All broken down
      - I will always be there
      - Rest your weary head
      - Dismiss your doubt
      - I will always be there
      - This won't get broken
